“I really don’t know where I went wrong.”

I huddled on the top step, listening to my dad unload to his friend Beelzebub at the entrance to the 6th level of Hell.

“It’s not your fault, Satan. All kids hit a rebellious stage in their teenage years.”

“She was such a good little girl. I hardly know what to do.”

“Send her to Heaven for summer break. That will make her wish she never strayed from the path.”

“Yeah, maybe. God still owes me for letting Jesus in here for a stint.”

I tiptoed away, my mind racing. Heaven. What would that be like? I had heard horror stories, of course. No ice cream, no rock music, no halter tops. But no one I knew had really been there. Were the stories actually true?

I checked my iPhone--another thing not found in Heaven, thanks to Apple’s support of Chinese censorship. Probably enough time to sneak out and be back before Dad got home from work. Just in case, I sent him a text, “Studying at Jan’s,” and sent one to my friend, Jan, letting her know my cover. Then I popped over to the moral realm.

Walking down the street, I saw a guy ahead of me take a final drag from his cigarette and reach to toss the smoldering butt in the dry patch of grass next to the sidewalk. I hiked up my skirt and unfastened the top few buttons of my blouse as I lengthened my stride to catch up. I grabbed his wrist as he made to release the cigarette.

“What the--” he broke off as he caught sight of my now-exposed cleavage and thighs.

I batted my eyelashes and purred, “Sorry. I just hate seeing those butts on the ground. I sunbathe on the grass sometimes, and the cigarette butts really ruin the ambiance.” I paused to let the image of me sunbathing on the grass sink in.

“You know,” I gave him a shy smile as we continued walking. “I wonder why a handsome man like you goes and ruins his breath with cigarettes. You look like you’d be a good kisser otherwise.”

I stopped walking as we reached a public ashtray and dropped the cigarette but in. Ogling at me, the guy pulled out his pack of cigarettes and tossed them in the neighboring trash can.

“Well, this is my stop.” I gestured to the building behind me. “Nice meeting you.”

As I ducked into the building, I checked my phone again and saw a text from Dad. “Family dinner at 7.” Oops. I forgot about our weekly dinner. I quickly transported back to Hell and jogged to the back of our house where a dead tree with a perfect make-out nook (maybe that’s why the tree ended up in Hell?) stood below my window. The light was on in the kitchen. Drat. He beat me home. I’ll just climb up and pretend I’ve been chilling in my bedroom waiting for dinner.

I hoisted myself up the tree. As I straddled my windowsill, ready to swing my other leg inside, I heard a noise that sounded like a throat being cleared. I looked up to see my dad sitting on the corner of my bed, arms crossed.

“Do you normally come home by way of your bedroom window?”

“No I uh…”

He strode across the room to flick on the lights while I clambered the rest of the way in.

“Where were you?” he demanded.

“At Jan’s, studying.”

“Try again.” He glowered at me. “I called Jan’s mom, and she confirmed you weren’t there. Were you, by any chance, in the *mortal realm*? Shiva told me she saw you stop a man from throwing his cigarette butt into the grass. She has a fire planned that you ruined.”

I remained silent.

“I don’t know what to do with you, young lady. You are so talented, yet you squander your gift.”

“I’m not squandering it! I’m using it!”

“To persuade people to *do good*? I had to bribe Shiva to keep quiet about what she saw. You are an embarrassment and a disgrace to my name.” He paced the room angrily. “You are going to Heaven, young lady.”

“But finals!” I protested.

“Obviously not important since you weren’t studying tonight, and apparently that school isn’t teaching you anything given your actions. You will spend summer break in Heaven. Be ready at 7 AM. Gabriel will pick you up.”

With that, he stormed out of the room.

I flopped onto my bed. Heaven. What a lousy place to spend summer vacation.
