For most species of the galaxy, a knife is the only necessary kitchen gadget. But not for humans. Humans have apple slicers, pineapple slicers, watermelon slicers, even banana slicers.

When humans finally made contact with the rest of the galaxy, their kitchen gadgets were all the rage. Banana prices skyrocketed as every alien tried to get their hands on a banana to try out their new banana slicer.

And so, we thought, why stop there? Why limit ourselves to gadgets that humans invented for no real purpose? (Because let's face it: Do you really need a special tool to slice a banana?)

We threw together parts--blades in geometric patterns, multi-headed spoons, double-ended forks--and put humans in a kitchen full of food with no other tools. The humans did not fail to impress. They started new fads around needs that did not exist.

It was such a hit that we turned it into a reality TV show (a popular human form of entertainment that also swept the galaxy). In the show, humans have to prepare a dinner party for 20 people in 2 hours, armed only with gadgets never before revealed to the galaxy. And thus the almond peeler, strawberry seed extractor, and oatmeal masher were born.

The human to platter the best feast (as determined by two crowd-worshipped judges) wins 10,000 Earth American dollars and fame. And us? We patent every gadget in advance and immediately buy up food commodities.
