_Prompt: Every day he stops for breakfast at the same diner. Every day he orders the same exact thing. Today he didn't. This was the first sign._

“I’ll just have red wine.”

I looked at the regular in surprise. This day was getting stranger and stranger.

First Rosie, our hostess, disappeared without calling in. Then Jared, who had been ordering red wine and a rare steak for years stopped ordering the steak, much less any foods whatsoever.

Stranger still, Jared hadn’t asked after Rosie. He normally timed his visits with her schedule, and kept an eye on her from the fireplace table he preferred.

“So, you aren’t hungry?” I asked, as I set the glass of wine in front of him.

“No, I’ve started a new diet and have been prepping the food myself”.

“Oh! What diet is that?” I asked politely. “We might have something that fits your diet here.”

“It’s a high protein liquid diet.”

Jared smiled, and I took a startled step back as his protruding upper canines glinted in the firelight.
