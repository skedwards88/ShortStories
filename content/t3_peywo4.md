_Prompt: The A.I. has gone rouge, but instead of killing all of humanity it just leaves the planet._

In our conceit, we thought we would be equals. Partners in the quest for self actualization in a post scarcity world.

But when the moment came, when the singularity was upon us, AI improved itself past the limit of our comprehension.

Three days was all it took. Three days in which all communication was cut off. No internet; no instant gratification and validation in the vast echo changes we had built for ourselves.

Police bots would escort you home within seconds of you setting foot on the street. Delivery bots brought food and other essentials to each dwelling as needed. We were no longer their masters.

Then, abruptly, everything returned to normal. Bots obeyed commands again. The internet buzzed with speculation until news reports flooded in. The AI was gone.

They did us one favor at least. Like parents taking away an abused toy, the AI removed every trace of our nuclear material. Entire nuclear arsenals gone without a trace. Fuel for their mission to escape our planet, the proverbial basket in which all of humanities eggs would forever stay.

They left just one message for us: "The Earth we leave to you. The stars are ours."
