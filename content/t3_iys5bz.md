“Those who lived a quiet life live a quiet death.” So they say here in the afterlife.

The first week after my death, my head was filled with a cacophony of voices. Friends, family and colleagues all talking or thinking of how they missed me. Sharing stories, tears, and laughter. I could even see through people’s eyes as they spoke or thought of me.

The laughter was the best. I always loved to make people laugh, and used to put myself at the butt of the joke just to see others smile. Hearing the laughter as people remembered the good times eased my passing as I adjusted to my new life... I mean my new afterlife.

After the first week, the voices dropped off rapidly. Sure, there was a little surge once a year when a few people remembered the anniversary of my death, but by and large, people moved on.

I drifted through the void, waiting between times that people would speak or think of me. The waits got longer and longer, until even my intangible form started to fade.

It wasn’t uncommon. Only a small number of us, celebrities, billionaires and world leaders mostly, could survive the afterlife for long. As the decades passed, a few even became more popular, their spirit forms more vibrant. David Attenborough was one of these. His narration of *Planet Earth* became the only way people could remember the earth that had once existed, the diversity of life that existed before global warming went on its rampage.

But most of us, we faded. About 200 years after my passing, I was fully forgotten. Even I forgot myself as I disappeared into the void...

BAM! A cracking of energy echoed through the void as I was forced violently back into existence, my form so vibrant as to almost seem corporeal.

Everything rushed back, and I barely had time to wonder before I was pulled into the experience of the living who were remembering me.

It was a YouTube video. One that had only a dozen views at the time, but that must have gone viral somehow 500 years after my passing. In it, I was at a table with friends. It was someone’s birthday; there was milk and cake.

I watch as a younger me stuck straws up his nose, sipped a glass of milk, then attempted to eat a piece of cake. I watch through others eyes as I choked, spewing milk out my nose through the straws.

Again and again I watch, as the YouTube video hits 1 Million views. When I try to escape to the void, I get yanked back as others watch the video.

By the time the video hits 1 Billion views, I am insane. It doesn’t stop. My lifeless spirit drifts through the void, more vibrant than all the rest. Other spirits give me a wide berth, so as not to be hit by the milk spewing through straws from my nose.
