_Prompt: They found the first body by the lake, mouth stuffed full of corn flakes. The second was found lying facedown in a bowl of Cheerios. By the time they found the third, covered in pop tarts, they knew: there was a cereal killer on the loose._

We expected the killer to be a college student. The low cost and high sugar content matched the profile.

We were shocked to find the head of General Mills Post Kellogg Conglomerate behind the killings.

"My whole career, I had to be so patient, waiting for obesity to do the job that I craved," the killer bemoaned. "Yes, I murdered countless numbers through the high sugar content and low nutrition. I even cleverly marketed some as health foods, snaring even the casually health conscious consumers. But the kills never felt like mine. Until now, they were just a statistic I saw from the sidelines."
