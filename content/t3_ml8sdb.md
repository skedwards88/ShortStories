_Prompt: An immortal being occasionally traps people in a pocket dimension until they agree to play chess with him, for fun. It’s been 3 months since the last human was transported there, and they still haven’t left._

I felt the strands of my dimension vibrate. A slow smile crept over my face. I had caught another human.

This one was male, early thirties, sleep circles under his eyes and a mask on his face. He was walking home from the store when I snared him from the shadows.  

His body convulsed in fear when he saw me, his eyes frantically trying to follow all 8 of my legs.

“Fear not human,” I commanded. “For you will be spared if you beat me at a game.” A chess board appeared between us.

“And if I lose, you’ll eat me?” The man asked nervously. “I have children to get home to. They are home indefinitely from school. I have a job that expects me to log in tomorrow!”

“Nonsense. The trivialities of a physical body do not hold here. We need neither food nor drink. If you lose, we will simply play again. Once you win, you may return to your family. Time itself is different here. When you return, little time will have passed on your plane.”

I saw his mind working, mouth opening and closing like a guppy as he came to terms with his new predicament.

...It’s been months since. Never have I played with a human who was so bad at chess. Even when I try to let him win, he just makes even more foolish mistakes.

“Oopsie!” The man exclaimed jovially, placing his queen right in front of my castle for the third game in a row.

“Are you even trying?” I snapped.

And that’s when I realized it, as he smiled up at me. The sleep circles under his eyes were gone.
