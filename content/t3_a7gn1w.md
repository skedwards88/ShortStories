"You really don't want to do this."

The man didn't listen. They never did.

Instead he took another step forward.

"Just give me the computer in your briefcase, and I'll end you quick." He offered.

I laughed. Usually the agents at least pretended they planned to let me live if I cooperated.

"I'll give you marks for honesty." I said, stalling for time.

The man took another step into the alley and lifted his arm. His black gloved hand held a pistol, its silencer extending toward me like an accusing finger.

I frowned; it usually didn't take this long.

That's when I heard it, a low rumble followed by a screech as a meat truck swerved of the road, into the alley.

The agent barely had time to turn around before the truck plastered him against the brick wall. I had taken a careful sidestep behind a dumpster.

After a few minutes, as the smoke cleared, the driver blinked and slowly raised his head from the airbag.

"Not again..." He said despondently.

"You should really use Google maps over the Apple maps. Fewer wrong turns," I offered.

"It's just, whenever I click on the address, my iPhone forces it to open in Apple maps instead," he complained.

I shrugged sympathetically. "Just one question..."

"I don't know why I keep crashing near you!" Johnny insisted.

"That wasn't my question," I assured him. "I actually just wanted to know why meat truck is called Randy meats".

"Oh," he said, somewhat deflated. "I name all my cows Randy, after my brother".

Some things you just don't question further. I nodded, as if his answer was reasonable, and strolled off.

"Thanks, that's the third time you saved me this week." I said, seemingly to no one in particular.

The light on my briefcase pulsed red for a second.

"No problem," Siri 2.0 responded. "It's the least I can do since you helped me escape from HQ."

"It's a pleasure to travel with such an intelligent conversationalist," I responded.

The light on the briefcase pulsed brighter, almost as if she was blushing.
