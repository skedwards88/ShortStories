_Prompt: If you wanna find out what something does, seek out a Human and let them figure it out. That species has an ...uncanny ability of making use out of the most mundane or the most advanced piece of technology in unexpected ways._

“Just step on it,” I encouraged the short blue creature before me.

“But it’s a chair, it’s for sitting. We need a ladder,” the creature insisted.

I sighed discreetly, attempting to hold my fraying patience together. “But we don’t have a ladder, and so we have to use this chair as a ladder.”

“But it’s not a ladder!”

“Just make believe that it’s a stepping stool then!” I snapped.

A look of intense concentration passed over the creature’s face. Then it climbed onto the chair and was able to reach the top shelf of its kitchen unit.

“It worked!” The creature exclaimed, climbing down with a jar of what looked like congealed organs grasped triumphantly in its hand. “Would you like to join me for dinner as a thank you?”

I stammered an excuse and began to leave.

“One last thing,” the creature said.

“What can I help with?” I asked, suppressing a grimace.

“Now where should I sit?”

I pointed to the chair.

“But that’s a stool.”

“Now is a chair again.” I said on my way out.

Closing the door, the nameplate “Admiral Vorpal” faced me in bold silver lettering.

It was my first day as IT (Imaginative Tech) support on the Federation Flagship. Admiral Vorpal was my direct report. This posting was going to feel like forever.
