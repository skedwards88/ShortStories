Saint Peter frowned as he looked at my paperwork, mumbling under his breath.

When I had seen the word "Atheist" stamped across my folder in big red letters, I thought I would be promptly sent to hell. But instead, Saint Peter seemed to be combing through my records, trying to find any loophole that would get me into heaven.

"I don't suppose you had a last second profession of belief and repentance of sins before death?" Peter asked hopefully.

"No, it even says 'unrepentant' there." I informed him, pointing to a page.

"Yes, yes." Peter said, his voice edging on desperation. "But, you know, if you were to say you had, whose to say differently? I would sign of on it and we could get you in." He gestured at the pearly gates, which now that I looked at them, showed signs of disrepair. Flecks of paint were pealing off the bars.

"But that would be a lie."

Peter squeaked and dropped his pen. "No one is saying anything about lying!" He protested. "Just, um, a correction of the records based on your more recent recollections."

"You seem pretty desperate to get me in."

"Yes, well, you see... Our numbers are going down." Peter admitted dejectedly.

"Shouldn't the number of people in heaven go up as more people die?" There was a long pause.

"Not if those already here petition to be sent to hell."

I looked at Peter incredulously, and he continued. "Ever since the Air Conditioner was invented in 1902, Hell has become quite the popular destination. Terrible for the environment of course, global warming and all."

"But why would anyone want to leave heaven?"

"Some up here have gotten tired of eternal adoration of God. We keep a pretty strict rotation, choirs singing His praises at all times and preachers praising His greatness at every corner. But as His popularity up here dropped, God took to Twitter to get more attention. Right now we're keeping His numbers of followers up with bot farms from Russia that like everything he posts."

I shook my head in disbelief. "How do people get out once they're in heaven?"

"Well, as an atheist, you've probably read the Bible." I nodded and he went on. "Many Christians are surprised to learn how petty the Old Testament is. And Jesus did say he did not come to destroy any of the old laws. One only has to point to the Old Testament, and admit they didn't eat kosher, or that they wore garments of mixed material. All those clothes you folks make down on Earth, with 10% this and 20% that, it's hard not to violate that one."

"Final question," I said. "If those in heaven spend their time flattering your narcissistic boss, what do those in Hell do?"

"Whatever they want, really. Hell is just the separation from God. Everyone down there still has each other."

"Thanks for the invite," I gestured at the pearly gates. One side was slightly askew, and I noticed some cobwebs on the other. "But I think I'll pass. How do I get down to Hell?"

Peter sighed resignedly, then gestured behind me. "Go back down the corridor of light and take the first elevator on your left. Their reception desk is on level H1."
