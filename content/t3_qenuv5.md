_Prompt: Most people think of demonic possession as a bad thing, but that’s just because they don’t charge the demons rent._

“What would you trade your body for human?” The demon contained in my pentagram licked its lips expectantly.

“One million dollars upfront, and return of my body after two years,” I offered.

The demon frowned, already shaking its head.

“Even if I had that much, it’s too expensive.” It argued. “And for too short a time. I can offer $400,000 for four years.”

I decided to try another approach.

“What about $800,000 over 4 years, but we divide it into monthly installments. That should give you the opportunity to earn more money to pay it off fully. I don’t have your credit history, but I could offer 24% APR no questions asked. Once the body is fully paid off, it’s yours to keep. Repossession of my body would be triggered if two consecutive monthly payments are missed.”

The demon was skeptical at first, but once it realized that the payment scheme meant no upfront cost, it seemed happier.

“But how do I know your life is worth the investment?” The demon pressed.

Queue the 2 day test drive. I was glad that I had performed the summoning on a Friday evening.

The next two days were an odd but bearable experience. The demon enjoyed pizza, video games, Netflix, and trolling Reddit. I took a backseat to my own life, able to tune out and tune in whenever I wanted.

By Sunday evening, we had a deal and for the first time in years, I slept like a baby.

“What is this?!” The demon exclaimed when the alarm went off 6am Monday morning.

“Time for work,” I explained. “You have to work 5 days of the week just to survive. You know, pay rent, taxes, medical, car insurance, food. But don’t worry, I’ll give you some pointers.”

“You didn’t tell me this!”

“You didn’t ask.”

“Where do you work?”

“Karen’s Coffee Shop”

The next few years were hell for the demon. Actually, I think it preferred hell. Multiple times it tried to get a return, but the policy was clear. It barely made enough to cover living expenses, much less make the payments, and ended up depleting its savings. A little after 3 years, it defaulted and I repossessed my body $1M dollars richer.

That very morning, I texted Chad my resignation. That evening, I posted my resignation text to r/antiwork for sweet karma and joined the r/financialindependence subreddit.

I still think of that demon once in a while. I don’t think it remembers me as fondly.
